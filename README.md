# Data-Science
This repository contains several kinds of machine learning algorithms that I have written to analyze a dataset in Python. To do that I used the Numpy, Pandas, SKlearn, TensorFlow, and Keras. Below is the list of pedictin methods that I uploaded here:

- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- Kernel-SVM
- Random Forest Classification
- Deep Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network
